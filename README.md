# chrome-extension-trello-github

##Steps to install
1. Download the [crx extension file](chrome.crx?raw=true) and simply drop it onto a chrome window to install.
2. Either go to the extension options page or to trello.com (you'll be prompted) and input your Github username and access code.
3. If you don't have a Github user account, get one.
4. If you don't have a Github personal access token, there is a link in the extensions options to create one.
5. **Keep your access token safe.**

> Remember to keep your tokens secret; treat them just like passwords! They act on your behalf when interacting with the API.
